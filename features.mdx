## Document Organization and Hierarchy

You structure your docs using a flexible folder-based system. Create nested hierarchies to mirror your project's architecture, from high-level overviews to detailed API references. Paradoha gh supports MDX files for rich content with components like `<Callout>` and code blocks.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Project Root] --> B[Introduction]
    A --> C[Guides]
    C --> D[Quickstart]
    C --> E[Advanced]
    A --> F[API Reference]
    F --> G[Endpoints]
```

  <Step title="Reorder" icon="move">

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Collaboration and Version Control

Invite team members to edit docs in real-time or via Git integration. You track changes with commit history, branches, and pull requests, ensuring no work is lost.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="GitHub" icon="github">
    Connect your repo for seamless sync.
    
````bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/project-docs.git
cd project-docs
git add docs/features.mdx
git commit -m "Update features page"
git push origin main
````
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Direct Edits" icon="edit-3">
    Use the web editor for quick changes without local setup.
    
    <Callout kind="tip">
      Enable previews to review changes before publishing.
    </Callout>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Search and Navigation Tools

Paradoha gh includes full-text search across all docs, with filters for sections and tags. Navigation uses a dynamic sidebar that auto-generates from your hierarchy, plus breadcrumbs for context.

<Expandable title="Advanced Search Filters" default-open="true">
  Search by keywords, filter by `{tags=["api", "guide"]}`, or limit to recent updates.
</Expandable>

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Global Search | Instant results with highlighting |
| Sidebar Navigation | Collapsible tree view |
| Breadcrumbs | Quick path back to root |
| Tags | Categorize pages for filtering |

## Publishing and Sharing Options

Publish your docs to a custom domain or share via links. Embed pages in your site or generate static exports.

<CodeGroup tabs="Embed,Static Export">
  ```html
  <iframe src="https://docs.paradoha-gh.com/embed/features" width="100%" height="600"></iframe>
  ```
  ```bash
  npx paradoha-gh export --output ./dist
  # Serves static site from ./dist
  ```
</CodeGroup>

<Callout kind="success">
  Start by organizing your root folder, then invite collaborators to build together.
</Callout>
