## Upload Initial Project Files

Add your existing Markdown files, images, or configs to the space.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Drag & Drop" icon="upload">

    In your space editor:

    1. Open the **Files** panel.
    2. Drag files from your desktop directly into the upload zone.
    3. Supported formats: `.mdx`, `.md`, `.png`, `.jpg`, `.json`.

    Files auto-organize into folders like `docs/` or `assets/`.

  <Tab title="CLI Upload" icon="terminal">

    Use the Paradoha gh CLI for bulk uploads.

````bash
paradoha-gh login --email your@email.com
paradoha-gh space select my-project-docs
paradoha-gh upload ./src/docs/*.mdx --space my-project-docs
````

    This syncs your local `src/docs/` folder to the cloud space.
